### WELCOME TO THE TIDAL CREEK ASSESSMENT DASHBOARD!

#### Using the dashboard

Tidal creeks or tributaries are essential habitats in the Tampa Bay Estuary and serve as important focal points for understanding watershed inputs that affect water quality. A fundamental goal of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program is to develop effective nutrient management strategies to support the ecological function of tidal tributaries. In partnership with Sarasota Bay NEP, Charlotte Harbor NEP, and local government and agency stakeholders, preliminary methods have been developed for assessing the health of tidal tributaries based on exceedances of nitrogen concentrations ([2016 report](https://tbeptech.org/TBEP_TECH_PUBS/2016/TBEP_02_16_SW_FL_Tidal_Creeks_Final_Draft_Report_160121.pdf), 2019 report forthcoming). These assessments can support tracking of water quality management goals and can help refine restoration and management plans in priority tributaries, including those in need of hydrologic restoration that can support critical nursery habitats for sportfishes.

This dashboard provides an interface to view and download results for all tidal creeks that have been assessed in the initial report. The map to the left shows all locations where tidal creeks have been assessed, including those with insufficient data. Start by using the map icons on the left so draw a polygon over the map to select tidalcreeks of interest.  Once selected, the summary assessment tab will populate with data from the selection.  This tab provides an overall picture of the condition of tidal creeks.  The download tab can then be used to obtain a csv file for the selection.

#### Methods

The tidal creek dashboard uses data included in the [tbeptools](https://tbep-tech.github.io/tbeptools/) package for the population of tidal creeks in southwest Florida and includes only those creeks designated as tidal ([FDEP classes](https://floridadep.gov/dear/water-quality-standards/content/surface-water-quality-standards-classes-uses-criteria) 2 and 3M). The assessments use data from the FDEP [Impaired Waters Rule](https://www.flrules.org/gateway/ChapterHome.asp?Chapter=62-303) database, currently for run 56 available [here](http://publicfiles.dep.state.fl.us/DEAR/IWR/).  This includes data through January 10th, 2019. Raw data for both the IWR database and the tidal creek spatial date are available from the tbeptools package (see the [vignette](https://tbep-tech.github.io/tbeptools/articles/tidalcreeks.html)).  

Similar to the [water quality report card](https://shiny.tbeptech.org/wq-dash/), tidal creeks are assigned to categories within a management framework intended to serve as both a mechanism for evaluating data relative to the need for regulatory action, and to identify stewardship actions that, if properly pursued, preclude the need for any regulatory actions.  These action levels were based on fish as a biological response indicator.  Additional indicators that may be more sensitive to elevated nutrient concentrations have not yet been identified and are an area of current research.  Tidal creeks are assigned to one of four categories: 

<span style="color:#33FF3B; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__Target__</span>: At or below nitrogen concentrations that protect individual creek types within the larger population of creeks.

<span style="color:#F9FF33; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__Caution__</span>: A site-specific early warning concentration that an individual creek may be trending towards a eutrophic condition and can help prioritize where management actions should begin to identify actions to prevent a threshold exceedance.

<span style="color:#FFA500; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__Investigate__</span>: A concentration indicating a management action level that identifies a potential degradation point as an impetus to develop site-specific management actions.

<span style="color:#FF7F50; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__Act__</span>: A concentration indicating that regulatory actions may be needed to confirm the impairment and identify remediative actions for the creek watershed.

Conceptually, these thresholds appear in the figure below.

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics('www/tidalcreekreport.PNG')
```

The histogram in the above figure represents a range of nitrogen concentrations for tidal creeks in the West Central region of Florida that were simulated using the observed standard deviation of values and centered around the freshwater stream threshold of 1.65 mg/L.  Assignment of a creek into one of the four categories depends on a margin of safety from the threshold, a caution value that is tailored to each creek based on stream length, and a target as values below the caution level.  

Two different nutrient thresholds were used for assessment, the first being the freshwater creek threshold for the West Central region of Florida (shown above) and the second being the freshwater creek threshold for the peninsular region of Florida.  The table below shows these thresholds.  Note that the "Caution" category is a function of creek length. 

```{r}
totab <- tidaltargets %>% 
  rename(
    Region = region,
    Act = act,
    Investigate = investigate, 
    Caution = caution
  )
knitr::kable(totab)
```

A temporal component is also included in the assessment, whereby the overall score considers the individual categories that were observed in the previous ten years for the period of record.  For this analysis, the tidal creek assessments include data from 2008 to 2018 coinciding with the ten years prior from the most current year in the IWR period of record.  Each year of data in which nitrogen was measured at a site is compared to the appropriate thresholds and the overall score is based on the summation of categories across the years.  The overall scores are typically assigned conservatively, such that the overall score is based on the highest category that is exceeded.  For example, a creek is assigned to a "threshold" (red) category if only two of ten years exceeds the threshold, even if the remaining years are at target.  

Finally, it is important to note that the framework outcomes do not carry any regulatory authority and are not intended to supercede any State or Federal regulatory standards currently in place, including aquatic life criteria used to evaluate waterbody impairments or pollutant load reduction goals associated with existing or forthcoming total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). The nutrient management framework was developed to serve as a screening tool to identify creeks with elevated nutrient concentrations for further evaluation to protect their in stream ecology but is not designed to explicitly identify regulatory impairments (or lack thereof) or the needs of downstream waterbodies such as larger estuarine waters that may be in need of nutrient load reductions.
